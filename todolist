Things TODO:

EAGAIN back-off times:
	"The server can also ask the client to back off. If a server can operate
	with interrupts enabled while the physical disc is busy, and therefore
	still be able to process requests, it can tell the client that it is busy
	and to try again later. In this case, the EAGAIN error code will be
	returned for whatever command was being tried, and following the error
	code, will be a 16 bit little endian value giving how long to back off in
	milliseconds."
Thread-Safe Stack Thread:
	The stack thread and service threads both use and free() rbox[] entries;
	this needs to be locked with mutexes to avoid a nasty race condition bug.
	In connection with this, also want better waiting implementation for the
	service threads (which currently spin usleep(25000)).
Dylan's Broken Spec:
	Talk to winston about all the places where the TNFS spec != tnfsd, find
	out which is wrong in each case.
Hang Bug when not -d:
	If the -d option is not given, any processes attempting to read from the
	mounted FS will hang.  It's rather hard to fix a bug which can only be
	reproduced when debugging is disabled :(
Retries of Possibly-Dropped Packets:
	Since TNFS runs over UDP, packets can and will be dropped.  tnfuse needs
	to retry if a response doesn't come back within a set time.
	The correct place to do this is probably in dbg_send().
Remember Current Offset:
	Each file descriptor needs to have its offset stored, so we don't have to
	seek when it's not necessary.  This will save network roundtrips.
